This is a pack of chroma key savestates for SMG4's Mario recolors. If you were looking for savestates of Mario and Luigi themselves, see [this page.](https://weegeepie.neocities.org/savestates/) yes, I know these savestates were made by a bad person,
but they're the only good ones out there.
This pack will continue to be updated. The current characters included are:
- SMG4
- SMG3
- Xboxfan997
- FightingMario54321

I plan to include more characters, like MarioMario4321 in the future.

This does NOT include seperate savestates for different expressions. To do that, see [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o33pdMVl2Ow)

If a normal Super Mario 64 ROM crashes with these savestates, download [this patch](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1R-Hd_wZ8vEpQGUnyWJmZu16eCbDsx3AG/view?pli=1) and apply it
to a vanilla (AKA 8MB) SM64 ROM, and when you're in the ROM, set the memory size to 8MB in Project64.

These probably won't work with PJ64 3.0+, I recommend either 2.3.2 or 1.6, or even better, [Luna's Project64.](https://github.com/Luna-Project64/Luna-Project64/releases)
