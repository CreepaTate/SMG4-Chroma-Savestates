# SMG4 Chroma Savestates

This is a pack of chroma key savestates for SMG4's classic Mario recolors, and Mario and Luigi themselves.
This pack will no longer be updated. The characters included are:
- SMG4
- SMG3
- Xboxfan997
- FightingMario54321
- Enzo (Roprinplup14)
- MarioMario54321
- MCGustavo
- Naked Mario
- Mario
- Luigi

This does NOT include seperate savestates for different expressions. To add expressions, see [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o33pdMVl2Ow)

The savestates were created with [this patch.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1R-Hd_wZ8vEpQGUnyWJmZu16eCbDsx3AG/view?pli=1)

These probably won't work with PJ64 3.0+, I recommend either 2.3.2 or 1.6, or even better, [Luna's Project64.](https://github.com/Luna-Project64/Luna-Project64/releases)

Do NOT unzip the zip files. They WILL break.

Some of the characters may not use the EXACT color codes as in the SMG4 series, as they may not be publicly available, so some characters will be recreations.
